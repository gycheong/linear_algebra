# Linear Algebra
This repository aims to provide condense and rigorous notes on Linear Algebra from several established sources. At the moment, the main reference is [Linear Algebra Done Wrong by Sergei Treil](https://www.math.brown.edu/streil/papers/LADW/LADW.html), but I may include more references if I decide to cover more topics for optional reading. Possible topics are Data Science and Machine Learning from [my machine learning repository](https://github.com/gycheong/machine_learning).

The target audience is a population of students who had a more computational introduction of Linear Algebra focusing on the use of reduced row echelon forms. For example, I am assuming that the audience has gone through almost all of the first five chapters of [the text written by Lay, Lay, and McDonald](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/linear-algebra-and-its-applications/P200000006235/9780136880929). The reader can also follow Treil's book from the beginning, the notes in this repository will be a more condensed version of his book for now.
