    "**Theorem**. Let $V$ be a vector space over $\\mathbb{F}$. If $V$ is spanned by finitely many vectors in $V$, then for any two bases $\\mathcal{B}$ and $\\mathcal{B}'$, we have $|\\mathcal{B}| = |\\mathcal{B}'|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark/Definition**. Note that we already know that once we have a finite spanning set of $V$ then we can extract a basis from it. The above theorem says that although we can have different bases to $V$, their sizes must be the same; such a size is called the **dimension** of $V$, and we write $\\dim(V)$ to mean it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, even when $V$ is not necessarily generated by finitely many vectors, it turns out that $V$ does have a basis and any two bases have the same cardinality. However, we will not discuss much about such vector spaces in this class. Such vector spaces are said to be \"infinite-dimensional\", and they arise quite commonly in more advanced real/complex analysis."
