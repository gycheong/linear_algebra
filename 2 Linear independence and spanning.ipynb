From the way it is consturcted, the set of linear combinations of $\\boldsymbol{v}_1, \\dots, \\boldsymbol{v}_{m-i}$ (i.e., the **span** of such vectors) must contain $\\boldsymbol{v}_{m-i+1}, \\boldsymbol{v}_{m-i+2}, \\dots, \\boldsymbol{v}_{m}$. Hence $\\boldsymbol{v}_1, \\dots, \\boldsymbol{v}_{m-i}$ must span $V$. The linear independence of $\\boldsymbol{v}_1, \\dots, \\boldsymbol{v}_{m-i}$ follows from HW 1 Problem 1. This finishes the proof. $\\Box$"
